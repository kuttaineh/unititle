## Let's make our societies civil again. 
To witness this end, we divide the unimproved value of the earth equally across all conceived living beings.

## Predistribution as Right
[These figures derived](https://gist.github.com/kuttaineh/8b7830a1a3e0f10467b90cd3049424d4) come from the whole landmass of the earth divided by three population sizes. Predistribution as a right eliminates homelessness coming out of the lack of an explicit title.

| With predistribution folk have a fallback position in any employment negotiation. | Chesterton's vision.                                 |

| Universal title is the equal holding of unimproved land value predistributed for the purpose of abolishing inequity without placing limits upon human potential. <br><br> If an employer is unable to make a sufficient return for labor then one could claim their share of the earth in physical form and take up vertical farming. Nothing prevents any from keeping both a garden and working jobs if this were their decision. <br><br> This equal right to land becomes the basis for the defense of government. <br><br> Idea drawn from [The Outline of Sanity](https://archive.org/details/theoutlineofsanity) and the major works of [Henry George](https://hgchicago.org/links/henry-georges-books/). | ![Three acres and a cow](Three_acres_and_a_cow.jpeg) |
