> “But it is not too soon to provide by every possible means that as few as possible shall be without a little portion of land.” —Thomas Jefferson, [28 October 1785 letter to James Madison, Sr.](https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/01-08-02-0534)

## Let's make our societies civil again. 
To witness this end, we divide the unimproved value of the earth equally across all conceived living beings.

## Predistribution as Right
[These figures derived](https://gist.github.com/kuttaineh/8b7830a1a3e0f10467b90cd3049424d4) come from the whole landmass of the earth divided by three population sizes. Predistribution as a right eliminates homelessness coming out of the lack of an explicit title.

| **Universal Title** is the equal holding of unimproved land value predistributed for the purpose of abolishing inequity without placing undue limits upon human potential. <br><br> In a corporate conflict: if an employer is unable to make a sufficient return for labor then one could claim their share of the earth in physical form and take up vertical farming. <br><br> In a social conflict: territorial disputes become evened out via the principle that every human on Earth is entitled to an even share of it. In cases of title dispute those not willing to recognize existing documents would be subject to judicial review in a neutral court in order to determine the compensation necessary to make the plaintiffs whole. | ![Henry George and child](https://www.foundsf.org/images/6/68/Litersf1%24henry-george-and-child.jpg) |
[This equal right to land value](https://github.com/kuttaineh/unknotted#how-shall-the-social-contract-be-defined) becomes the basis for the defense of government. <br><br> The ratio of land to land value any are willing to claim right and responsibility towards is left to the heads of household to determine, understanding that any amount claimed beyond the equal share of unimproved resources becomes subject to the primary levy for funding a government where every governed member has relevant say with regard to the specific outcomes affecting the parties subject to its decision. <br><br> Idea drawn from [The Outline of Sanity](https://archive.org/details/theoutlineofsanity) and the major works of [Henry George](https://hgchicago.org/links/henry-georges-books/). | ![Three acres and a cow](Three_acres_and_a_cow.jpeg) |
