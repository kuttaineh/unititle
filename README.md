# Universal Title
the basis of isocracy

## Make our societies civil again. 
In proposal, in order to witness this end, we divide the value of the earth equally across all conceived living beings.

## Predistribution as Right
[These figures derived](https://gist.github.com/kuttaineh/8b7830a1a3e0f10467b90cd3049424d4) came from the whole landmass of the earth divided by three population sizes. This proposal eliminates homelessness coming out of a lack of an explicit title.

| Universal title is distributed value landholding for the purpose of abolishing inquity without placing limits upon human acheivement. <br><br> If an employer is unable to make a sufficient return for labor then one could claim their share of the earth in physical form and take up vertical farming. Nothing prevents any from keeping both a garden and working jobs if this were their decision. <br><br> This equal right to land becomes the basis for the defense of government. <br><br> The idea draws from the British analytic tradition of [The Outline of Sanity](https://archive.org/details/theoutlineofsanity) and the American revolutionary thinking of Henry George. | ![Three acres and a cow](Three_acres_and_a_cow.jpeg) |
