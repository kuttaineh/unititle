# Universal Title
the basis of isocracy

## Motivation
So that all girls may become ladies and all boys gentlemen let us establish a steady order wherein universal title to the value of the earth is a standard for all conceived human beings; let no corporation or any other legal fiction claim title to any unimproved portion of earth. How would that look? [Here’s a gist](https://gist.github.com/kuttaineh/8b7830a1a3e0f10467b90cd3049424d4) of that vision.

## Predistribution as Right
To arrive at [the figures derived](https://gist.github.com/kuttaineh/8b7830a1a3e0f10467b90cd3049424d4) I took the whole landmass of the earth and divided by the three example population sizes. This scenario eliminates the homelessness coming out of a lack of an explicit title. Note the right, as expressed, is Predistributionist in form.

In such an establishment workers always have a fallback position in any employment negotiation because if an employer isn't willing or is otherwise unable to make a sufficient return then the person could always claim their share of the earth in physical form and take up vertical farming. Also, nothing would prevent the same from keeping both a garden and working jobs if this were their choice. How to live is left to the individual to determine.

Note I'm not calling for a right under man but one under heaven. Still tho I am asking my fellow human beings, regardless of their metaphysical views, to recognize this new universal human right as preexisting to government while adding this part as another piece of the basis for which governments are established —— the defense of the rights of all people being the proper, and only legitimate cause, for which they are built —— in order to protect.

Having invoked Locke's [Social Contract](https://github.com/kuttaineh/unknotted#how-shall-the-social-contract-be-defined) theory with perhaps a bit of Hobbes & Rousseau I'm having to note that this is out of the American, not French, model of revolutionary thinking.

Unencumbered small landholding, or the value thereof if you want to get technical, is the right defined for the purpose not to establish a world based upon the works of Murray Rothbard ——— for that would result in a rentier's paradise ——— but rather Thom Jefferson's idea of the small landholder being the most precious part of the state and the greatest defense of liberty. And in this scenario of [Ward Republics](https://web.archive.org/web/20230331120509/https://constitution.org/1-Activism/reform/us/ward_republic.html) therein is practiced universal suffrage along with universal title.
